// Replacement for pthread rwlocks - subclass of PTMutex
// ObtainMutex() and AttemptMutex() behave like a regular mutex,
// obtaining an exclusive (write) lock.
// Use ObtainShared() or AttemptShared() to get a read-lock.
// This differs from pthread rwlocks in that you can obtain
// an exclusive lock even if you already have a shared one,
// and vice versa, provided no other threads hold one.
// Some pthreads implementations behave like this, but not all,
// and not the one in Linux.

// Another difference is that this implementation tracks the
// exclusive attribute in a stack-like manner - so the call sequence
// ObtainMutex(); ObtainMutexShared(); ReleaseMutex(); ReleaseMutex()
// will leave the mutex in exclusive mode until the second release.

// ObtainMutexShared(), ObtainMutex(), ObtainMutexShared(),
// ReleaseMutex(), ReleaseMutex(), ReleaseMutex()
// Will promote the mutex to Exclusive mode at the ObtainMutex()
// call, and revert to shared mode after the second ReleaseMutex().
