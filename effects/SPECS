Architecture:

PPEffectHeader - maintains a list of active effects, which are defined by:
PPEffect - superclass for the effects themselves.  Provides an Apply method
  which chains the effect to a provided ImageSource.
  
EffectListSource - an accessor class for a static list of effect descriptions.
  The static list of descriptions also includes any parameters needed by the
  effect - these are used as defaults when either an effect or a widget is
  created.
  provides methods to get IDs, Translated names and Icons, as well as
  methods for creating the effect itself, and for creating a widget.
  Also a function to apply a widget's state to an effect.
